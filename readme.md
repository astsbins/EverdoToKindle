# Everdo -> Kindle 
The idea of this project is for me to be able to see my todolist in everdo on my kindle. Since everdo stores all info conveniently in a sqlite file locally its getting the todolist out of it is not too difficult.

The plan is to make a webserver that will read that db file and serve up a simple webpage. 
Then have a custom app written for a jailbroken kindle 4 to display it. Then when it goes to sleep it will keep showing the latest version.
